# Motivation

When you start a new Single page application project everything is beatiful, you are in love with the framework, `ng generate` is you best friend, and so on.

The you you add one component here, another component there, some grams of `this.router.navigate()` and voil√°! the magic happens.

Then time goes by and the navigation between components starts go get a little, err... challenging...

And as time goes by the challenge only grows. This motivated me to build this little flow management to remove the decision of the ***next route*** from the components to the a set of rules.

# How it works 

These are the main concepts described in this image:
- set of rules
- domain data
- next route calculation
