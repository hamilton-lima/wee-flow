# wee-flow
Workflow management for angular applications

## Install

```

# Motivation

When you start a new Single page application project everything is beatiful, you are in love with the framework, `ng generate` is you best friend, and so on.

The you you add one component here, another component there, some grams of `this.router.navigate()` and voil√°! the magic happens.

Then time goes by and the navigation between components starts go get a little, err... challenging...

And as time goes by the challenge only grows. This motivated me to build this little flow management to remove the decision of the ***next route*** from the components to the a set of rules.

# How it works 

These are the main concepts described in this image:
- set of rules
- domain data
- next route calculation

# Implementation plan 

## Phase 1
| task | status |
| --- | --- | 
| First route | Done | 
| Domain data update | Done | 
| Set of rules | Done | 
| Rules parsing | Done | 
| Navigate to the next route | Done | 
| Save workflow state to continue navigation | Done | 
| Add url guard to restore state and validate the current page | Done |
| Publish library to npm

## Phase 2
| task | status |
| --- | --- | 
| Create editor | 
| Rules definition upgrade should reset saved state? |
| Add route to be called when no next route is found | 
| Add example where the rules can be manually edited |
| Validate set of rules | 

## Phase 3
| task | status |
| --- | --- | 
| Expose events |
